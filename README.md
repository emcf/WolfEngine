# WolfEngine

This is a [Wolfenstein-3D style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) game engine using only the .NET System.Drawing library. That means _No OpenGL, no OpenTK, no DirectX, no XNA. No GPU acceleration. No parallelization._ The engine includes depth buffer lighting, textures, and easy level creation.
